## Architecture Decision Records

This document will state why some the architecture looks like it is today. Why certain choices have been made and which assumptions have been made at the time of making the decision.

Only decisions relevant to the Bouwbesluit backend server project will be stated here.


### tech stack choices
We have chosen to work with a java as a language as this will allow us to reuse the java api for the bimserver. Furthermore SpringBoot is used for easy deployability. Heroku will be used as a hosting platform due to TnO already having licenses in place and proven functionality with SpringBoot.
